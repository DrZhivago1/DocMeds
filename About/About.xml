A mod which allows the disassembling and assembling of Archotech technology after the required "Nanite Production" research. This is a late-game technology and objects will produce nanites upon being disassembled. There is also a "scrambling" recipe included which allows players to randomly change neurotrainers... for a price (also note that all crafted neurotrainers are randomized).
