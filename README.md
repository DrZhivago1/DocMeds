========
A mod which allows the disassembling and assembling of Archotech technology after the required "Nanite Production" research. This is a late-game technology and objects will produce nanites upon being disassembled. There is also a "scrambling" recipe included which allows players to randomly change neurotrainers... for a price (also note that all crafted neurotrainers are randomized). Items are as follows:

| **Item** | **Assemble Skill** (CRAFTING/INTELLECTUAL)| **Disassemble Skill** (CRAFTING/INTELLECTUAL) | **Nanite Yield** | **Tech Required** | **Production Bench**  |
| ------------- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| AI Persona Core  | 20/20  | 15/15  | 75  | Nanite Production | Fabrication Bench |
| Healer Mech Serum  | 13/13  | 11/11 | 20  | Nanite Production  | Fabrication Bench |
| Neurotrainer Mech Serum  | 11/11  | 9/9  | 10  | Nanite Production  | Fabrication Bench |
